\label{sec:grid}

For matrix \DDFproblems,
we present empirical results as a first step towards covering number bounds. %
We begin by testing a cover construction. %
If the construction fails to achieve a conjectured upper bound in a numerical experiment,
then either the conjecture is false,
or the construction is not efficient.
A natural idea is to extend
the geometrically spaced sequence of $b$ values from
\lemmaref{lem:scalar-cost-ub}
to multiple dimensions.
We now make this notion, illustrated in \Cref{fig:geomgrid}, precise.

\begin{definition}[Geometric grid partition]
\label{def:geomgrid}
	Given a \DDFproblem\ with $\bSigma = [\recip \breadth, 1]^d$,
	and a grid pitch $k \in \N_+$,
	select
	$s_1, \dots, s_{k+1}$
	such that
	$s_1 = \recip \breadth$,
	$s_{k + 1} = 1$,
	and $\frac{s_{i+1}}{s_i} > 0$
	is constant.
	For each $j \in [k]^d$, define the grid cell
	\(
		\bSigma(j) = \textstyle \prod_{i=1}^d [s_{j(i)}, s_{j(i) + 1}],
	\)
	where $j(i)$ is the $i\th$ component of $j$.
	The cells satisfy
	\(
		\bSigma = \textstyle \bigcup_{j \in [k]^d} \bSigma(j),
	\)
	thus forming an partition (up to boundaries) of $\bSigma$ into $k^d$ cells.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Empirical upper bound on $\coveringnum{\alpha}{\Envs}$.}
In this experiment, we construct $2$-suboptimal covers of
the linearized quadrotor for varying $\breadth$
using geometric grids.
We begin with the guess $k = 1$.
For each grid cell $\bSigma(j)$, we compute a controller $K(j)$ using GCC synthesis
and check if $\bSigma(j) \subseteq \suboptneighb{2}{K(j)}$.
(This requires evaluating only one Lyapunov equation due to \lemmaref{lem:lancaster-ARE-domination}.)
If not, we increment $k$ and try again.
Termination is guaranteed by continuity.
Results for this experiment
with $\breadth \in [1, 100]$
are shown in
\Cref{fig:quadrotor_covering}.
The required grid pitch $k$ follows roughly logarithmic growth,
as indicated by the linear least-squares best-fit curve in black.
Small values of $\breadth$ are excluded from the fit (indicated by black markers),
as we do not expect the asymptotic behavior to appear yet.

These results do not rule out
the $\log(\theta)^d$ growth suggested by
the geometric grid construction.
Testing larger values of $\breadth$
is computationally difficult because the number of grid cells becomes huge
and the GCC Riccati equation \eqref{eq:petersen-riccati}
becomes numerically unstable for very small $\Sigma$.

\paragraph{Efficiency of geometric grid partition.}
\label{sec:are-geometric-efficient}

Given an $\alpha$-suboptimal geometric grid cover,
we examine a measurable quantity that may reflect the ``efficiency'' of the cover.
Intuitively,
in a good cover we expect 
the worst-case suboptimality ratio of each controller $K(j)$ relative to its grid cell $\bSigma(j)$
to be close to $\alpha$.
If it close to $\alpha$ for some cells but significantly less than $\alpha$ for others,
then the grid pitch around the latter cells is finer than necessary.
We visualize results for this computation on the linearized quadrotor
with $\theta = 10,\ k = 4$
in \Cref{fig:gridratios}
---
only the corners of the $4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4$ grid are shown.
The suboptimality ratio is close to $\alpha = 2$
for cells with low control authority (near $\Sigma = \recip \theta I$),
but drops to around $1.4$
for cells with high control authority (near $\Sigma = I$).
The difference suggests that the geometric grid cover could be more efficient in the high-authority regime.

\paragraph{Efficiency of GCC synthesis.}
One possible source of conservativeness is that
\lemmaref{lem:petersen-gcc} applies to the affine image of
a $m \times n$-dimensional matrix norm ball,
but we only require guaranteed cost on
a $d$-dimensional affine subspace of matrices.
In other words, we ask GCC synthesis to ensure $\alpha$-suboptimality on systems that are not actually part of $\Envs$.
If this is negatively affecting the result,
then we should observe that the worst-case cost of $K(j)$ on $\bSigma(j)$
is less than the trace of the solution $P$ for the GCC Riccati equation \eqref{eq:petersen-riccati}.
The worst-case cost always occurs at the minimal $\Sigma \in \bSigma(j)$ by \lemmaref{lem:lancaster-ARE-domination};
we evaluate it with \eqref{eq:cost-suboptimal}.
For the quadrotor,
a mismatch sometimes occurs for smaller values of $\theta$,
but it does not occur for the large values of $\theta$.
