In this paper, we introduced and motivated the
$\alpha$-suboptimal covering number
to quantify infinite \envword\ spaces
for \multienv\ control problems.
We defined a particular class of \multienv\ linear-quadratic regulator problems
amenable to analysis of the $\alpha$-suboptimal covering number,
and showed logarithmic dependency on the problem ``breadth'' parameter $\breadth$ in the scalar case.
Towards analogous results for the matrix case,
we presented empirical studies intended to shed light on possible proof techniques.
For the upper bound, we considered a natural covering construction that would preserve logarithmic dependence on $\breadth$
but give exponential dependence on dimensionality.
Experiments did not rule out its validity.
For the lower bound, we visualized suboptimal neighborhoods for two possible system classes
and observed interesting topological behavior for the minimal-coupling class.

After extending our current results to the matrix case,
in future work the analysis can be applied to other classes of \multienv\ LQR problems
including variations in $A, Q, R$,
discrete time, and stochastic dynamics.
It will be interesting to see if there are major differences between LQR variants.
We also hope that suboptimal covers and covering numbers will be a useful tool
for analyzing how the size of the \envword\ space
affects the required expressiveness of
function classes used in practice as \multienv\ policies,
such as neural networks.
