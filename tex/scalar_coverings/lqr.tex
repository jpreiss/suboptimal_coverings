A continuous-time, deterministic, infinite-horizon, time-invariant LQR problem with full-state feedback is defined by 
state space $\cX = \R^n$,
action space $\cU = \R^m$,
linear dynamics
\(
	\dot x = Ax + Bu,
\)
where $A \in \R^{n \times n},\ B \in \R^{n \times m}$, and quadratic cost 
\[
	J(\pi) = \E_{x(0) \sim \Normal(\zero, I)}
		\int_0^\infty \big(
			x^\top Q x + u^\top R u
		\big)\, \d t,
\]
where $Q \succeq \zero$ and $R \succ \zero$ are cost matrices of appropriate dimensions
and $\Normal(\zero, I)$ is the unit Gaussian distribution.
For the purposes of this paper, the pair $(A, B)$ is \emph{controllable}
if $J(\pi) < \infty$ for some policy $\pi$.
If $(A, B)$ is controllable,
then the optimal policy %
is the linear
$u = \Kopt{} x$,
where $\Kopt{} \in \R^{m \times n}$
can be computed
by finding the unique maximal positive semidefinite solution $P$
of the algebraic Riccati equation
\(
	A^\top P + P A - P B R^{-1} B^\top P + Q = \zero
\)
(henceforth called the \emph{maximal solution})
and letting $\Kopt{} = -R^{-1} B^\top P$
\citep{kalman-contributions}.
Additionally, $J(\Kopt{}) = \trace{P}$.
An arbitrary controller $K \in \R^{m \times n}$ is \emph{stabilizing} if
$J(K) < \infty$,
in which case $J(K)$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cost-suboptimal}
	J(K) = \trace{(Q + K^\top R K) W}\!, \
\text{where} \ \ 
	W = \int_0^\infty {e^{t(A + BK)}}^\top {e^{t(A + BK)}} dt.
\end{equation}
$W$ can be computed by solving the Lyapunov equation
\(
	(A + BK)^\top W + W (A + BK)  + I = \zero.

\paragraph{\Multidyn\ LQR}
\label{sec:multilqr}
A fully general formulation of \multienv\ LQR
would allow variations in each of $(A, B, Q, R)$,
but this creates redundancy.
Any LQR problem
where $Q \succ 0$
is equivalent via change of coordinates
to another LQR problem where $Q = I$ and $R = I$.
To reduce redundancy,
we consider only \emph{\multidyn} LQR problems where $Q = I_{n \times n}$ and $R = I_{m \times m}$
in this work.
The reference policy class is linear: $\Refpolicies = \R^{m \times n}$.

A \multidyn\ LQR problem can be defined by
$\Envs = \Aset \times \Bset$
for some sets $\Aset \subseteq \R^{n \times n}$ and ${\Bset \subseteq \R^{n \times m}}$,
but it is not obvious how to design $\Aset$ and $\Bset$.
To support an asymptotic analysis of
$\coveringnum{\subopt}{\Envs}$,
the \envword\ space $\Envs$ should have a real-valued ``breadth'' parameter $\breadth$
that sweeps from a single \envword\ to sets with arbitrarily large, but finite, covering numbers.
Matrix norm balls are a popular representation of dynamics uncertainty in the robust control literature,
but they can easily contain uncontrollable pairs,
and removing the uncontrollable pairs
can lead to an infinite covering number.
For example, in the scalar problem $\Aset = \{a\},\ \Bset = [-\breadth, 0) \cup (0, \breadth]$, where $a \neq 0$,
it can be shown that
no $\alpha$-suboptimal cover is finite.

These properties are worrying, but the example $\Bset$ is pathological.
The zero crossing is analogous to reversing the direction of force applied by an actuator in a physical system.
A more relevant multi-dynamics problem is variations
in mass or actuator strength,
whose signs are fixed.
We formalize this idea with the following definition.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:B-SVD}
	Fix $A \in \R^{n \times n}$
	and a \emph{breadth} parameter $\breadth \geq 1$.
	Let $\Aset = \{ A \}$ and
		$\Bset = \{ U \Sigma V^\top : \Sigma \in \bSigma \}$,
		where
		$\bSigma = \{ \diag(\sigma) : \sigma \in [\recip \breadth, 1]^d \}$.
	The matrices $U \in \R^{n \times d}$
	and
	$V \in \R^{m \times d}$ each have rank $d$, where
	$0 < d \leq \min \{n, m\}$.
	The tuple $(A, U, V, \breadth)$
	fully defines a \emph{\multienv\ LQR problem in decomposed dynamics form},
	or \emph{\DDFproblem} for brevity.
\end{definition}

We will abuse notation and associate $\Envs$ with both $\Aset \times \Bset$ and $\bSigma$
when the meaning is clear from context.
The continuity of the LQR cost \eqref{eq:cost-suboptimal} with respect to $B$
and the compactness of $\Envs$ for any $\breadth$ imply that
$\coveringnum{\alpha}{\Envs_\breadth}$ is always finite.
Variations in $A$ are redundant in the scalar case where we focus our theoretical work in this paper.
The definition can be extended to include them in future work.
