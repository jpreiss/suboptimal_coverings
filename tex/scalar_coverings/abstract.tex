	We propose the $\alpha$-suboptimal covering number
	to characterize \multienv\ control problems
	where the set of dynamical systems and/or cost functions is infinite,
	analogous to the cardinality of finite \envword\ sets.
	This notion may help quantify
	the function class expressiveness
	needed to represent a good \multienv\ policy,
	which is important for learning-based control methods that use parameterized function approximation.
	We study suboptimal covering numbers for
	linear dynamical systems with quadratic cost (LQR problems)
	and construct a class of \multienv\ LQR problems amenable to analysis.
	For the scalar case, we show logarithmic dependence on the ``breadth'' of the space.
	For the matrix case, we present experiments
	1) measuring the efficiency of a particular constructive cover, and
	2) visualizing the behavior of two candidate systems for the lower bound.
