\label{sec:results-scalar}


In this section we show logarithmic upper and lower bounds on
the growth of $\coveringnum{\alpha}{\Envs_\breadth}$ in $\breadth$
for scalar \DDFproblems.
We present several intermediate results in matrix form because they are needed for our empirical results later.
We begin with a key lemma in the framework of
\emph{guaranteed cost control} (GCC)
from \citet{petersen-guaranteed-cost},
simplified for our use case.

\begin{lemma}[GCC synthesis, \citet{petersen-guaranteed-cost}]
\label{lem:petersen-gcc}
	Given the \multienv\ LQR problem
		$\Aset = \{ A \}$,
		$\Bset = \{ B_1 \Delta + B_2 : \norm{\Delta} \leq 1 \}$,
	where $B_1, B_2 \in \R^{m \times p}$ are arbitrary for arbitrary $p$,
	and the state cost matrix is $Q \succ \zero$,
	if there exists $\tau > 0$ such that $P \succ \zero$ solves the Riccati equation
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:petersen-riccati}
		A^\top P + P A
		+ P \left(
			\textstyle \recip \tau B_1 B_1^\top - \recip{1+\tau} B_2 B_2^\top
		\right) P
		+ Q = \zero,
	\end{equation}
	then the controller
	\(
		K = -\recip{1 + \tau} B_2^\top P
	\)
	has cost $J_B(K) \leq \trace{P}$
	for all $B \in \Bset$.
	Also, $\trace{P}$ is a convex function of $\tau$.
\end{lemma}



We use the notation
\(
	P, \tau, K = \GCC(A, B_1, B_2, Q)
\)
to indicate that $P, \tau$ solve
\eqref{eq:petersen-riccati}
and $K$ is the corresponding controller.
It is straightforward to show that any \DDFproblem\
can be expressed in the form required by \lemmaref{lem:petersen-gcc}
with additional constraints on $\Delta$.

In the original presentation, \citet{petersen-guaranteed-cost} treat $B_1$ as given,
so they accept that
\eqref{eq:petersen-riccati} may have no solution
(for example, when $A = 2I, B_1 = I, B_2 = \zero$).
Our application requires constructing values of $B_1, B_2$ that guarantee a solution,
motivating the following lemma.
\defcitealias{lancaster-AREs}{Lan95}
We abbreviate the reference text \citet{lancaster-AREs} as \citetalias{lancaster-AREs}.



\begin{lemma}[existence of $\alpha$-suboptimal GCC]
\label{lem:petersen-existence}
	For the \DDFproblem\ $(A, U, V, \theta)$, if $B \in \Bset$ and $\alpha > 1$,
	then there exists $B_1 \neq \zero \in \R^{m \times n}$
	such that the GCC Riccati equation \eqref{eq:petersen-riccati}
	with $B_2 = B$
	has a solution $(P, \tau)$
	satisfying
	$\trace{P} \leq \alpha J^\star_{B}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For this proof, it will be more convenient to write the algebraic Riccati equation as
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:existence-ric}
		A^\top P + P A - P D P + Q = \zero,
	\end{equation}
	where $D \succeq \zero$.
	Let $\cD = \{ D \succeq \zero: (A, D)\ \text{ is controllable} \}$.
	Controllability of $(A, B)$
	implies that
	$BB^\top \in \cD\ $
	\citepalias[Corollary 4.1.3]{lancaster-AREs}.
	Let $\Ric_+$ denote the map from $\cD$ to the
	maximal solution of \eqref{eq:existence-ric},
	which is continuous %
	\citepalias[Theorem 11.2.1]{lancaster-AREs},
	and let $\cD_\alpha = \{D \in \cD : \trace{\Ric_+(D)} < \alpha J^\star_B \}$.
	The set $\cD_\alpha$ is open in $\cD$ by continuity
	and is nonempty because it contains $BB^\top$.
	Now define $B_1(\tau) = \tau B$ for $\tau \in (0, \half)$.
	The equivalent of $D$ in the GCC Riccati equation \eqref{eq:petersen-riccati} becomes
	\[
		\textstyle D(\tau) = -\recip \tau B_1(\tau) B_1(\tau)^\top + \recip{1 + \tau} B_2 B_2^\top
		= \frac{1 - \tau - \tau^2}{1 + \tau} B B^\top.
	\]
	As a positive multiple of $B B^\top$, we know $D(\tau) \in \cD$,
	and because $\lim_{\tau \to 0} D(\tau) = B B^\top$,
	the set of $\tau$ for which $D(\tau) \in \cD_\alpha$ is nonempty.
	Any such $\tau$ and $B_1(\tau)$ provide a solution.
\end{proof}

\noindent Finally, the following comparison result
will be useful in several places.

\begin{lemma}[\citetalias{lancaster-AREs}, Corollary 9.1.6]
\label{lem:lancaster-ARE-domination}
\newcommand{\alt}[1]{\tilde #1}
	Given two algebraic Riccati equations
	\[
		A^\top P + PA - P B B^\top P + Q = \zero
		\quad \text{ and } \quad 
		\alt{A}^\top P + P\alt{A} - P \alt{B}\alt{B}^\top P + \alt{Q} = \zero,
	\]
	with maximal solutions $P$ and $\alt{P}$,
	let
		$X = \bsmallmat{Q & A^\top \\ A & -BB^\top}$
		and
		$\alt{X} = \bsmallmat{\alt{Q} & \alt{A}^\top \\ \alt{A} & -\alt{B}\alt{B}^\top}$.
	If $X \!\succeq \!\alt{X}$, then $P \!\succeq \!\alt{P}$.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Scalar upper bound}

We are now ready to bound the covering number for scalar systems.
The first lemma bounding $J^\star_{a,b}$ will be useful for the lower bound also.
We then construct a cover inductively.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:scalar-cost-ub}
	In a scalar LQR problem,
	if $a > 0$ and $0 < b \leq 1$,
	then the optimal scalar LQR cost satisfies the bounds
	\(
		\nofrac{2a}{b^2}
		<
		J^\star_{a,b}
		<
		\nofrac{(2a + 1)}{b^2}.
	\)
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The lower bound is visible from
	the closed-form solution for the scalar Riccati equation, which is
	\(
		J^\star_{a,b} = \frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{b^2}.
	\)
	The upper bound is obtained by substituting $a^2 + b^2 \leq (a + 1)^2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:scalar-cover-recursion}
	If $p, \tau, k = \GCC(a, b_1, b_2, q)$,
	then for any $\beta \in (0, 1)$,
	there exists $k' \in \R$
	such that
	$\displaystyle p', \tau, k' = \GCC \left( a, \beta b_1, \beta b_2, \beta^{-2} q \right)$,
	where $\ p' = \beta^{-2} p$.%
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	In the scalar system,
	the GCC matrix Riccati equation \eqref{eq:petersen-riccati}
	reduces to the quadratic equation
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:scalar-ric}
		\left(
			\textstyle \recip \tau b_1^2
			- \recip{1 + \tau} b_2^2
		\right)
		p^2
		+ 2a p
		+ q
		= 0.
	\end{equation}
	Substituting $p' = \beta^{-2} p$ into \eqref{eq:scalar-ric}
	and multiplying by $\beta^{-2}$ yields
	a new instance of~\eqref{eq:scalar-ric}
	with the parameters
		$b_1' = \beta b_1$, \ 
		$b_2' = \beta b_2$, \ 
		$q' = \beta^{-2} q$,
	for which $p'$ is a solution
	with $\tau$ unchanged.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:covering-scalar}
	For the scalar \DDFproblem\ defined by
		$\Aset = \{ a \}$,
		where $a > 0$,
		and 
		$\Bset = \left[\textstyle \recip \breadth, 1 \right]$,
	if $\alpha \geq \frac{2a+1}{2a}$,
	then $\coveringnum{\alpha}{\Bset} = O(\log \breadth)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We construct a cover from the upper end of $\Bset$.
	By \lemmaref{lem:scalar-cost-ub},
	the condition ${\alpha \geq \frac{2a+1}{2a}}$ implies that
	\(
		J^\star_{b=1} < \alpha 2 a < \alpha J^\star_{b=1}.
	\)
	Therefore, by
	\lemmaref{lem:petersen-gcc,lem:petersen-existence},
	there exists $\beta \in (0, 1)$
	and
	$p, \tau, k$
	such that
	$p, \tau, k = \GCC(a, (1-\beta)/2, (1+\beta)/2, 1)$
	and
	$p \leq \alpha 2a$.

	Proceeding inductively,
	suppose that for $N \geq 1$,
	we have covered $[\beta^N, 1]$
	by the intervals $\Bset_n = [\beta^{n+1}, \beta^{n}]$
	for $n \in \{0, \dots, N-1\}$,
	and each $\Bset_n$ has a controller $k_n$ such that 
	\[
		\beta^{-2n}p, \tau, k_n = \GCC \left(
			a,
			\nofrac{(\beta^{n} - \beta^{n+1})}{2},
			\nofrac{(\beta^{n} + \beta^{n+1})}{2},
			\beta^{-2n}
		\right).
	\]
	Then the existence of the desired $\Bset_N, k_N$
	follows immediately from
	\lemmaref{lem:scalar-cover-recursion}.

	By \lemmaref{lem:lancaster-ARE-domination},
	for each $\Bset_n$
	the GCC state cost $q_n = \beta^{-2n} \geq 1$
	is an upper bound on the cost if we replace $q_n$ with $1$
	to match the \DDFproblem.
	Therefore,
	for each interval $\Bset_n$,
	for all $b \in \Bset_n$,
	\[
		\alpha J^\star_{b}
		\geq
		\alpha J^\star_{\beta^n}
		>
		\beta^{-2n} \alpha 2 a 
		\geq
		\beta^{-2n} p
		\geq
		J_b(k_n),
	\]
	where first inequality is due to \lemmaref{lem:lancaster-ARE-domination},
	the second is due to \lemmaref{lem:scalar-cost-ub},
	the third is by construction of $p$,
	and last is due to the GCC guarantee of $k_n$.
	Hence, $\Bset_n \subseteq \suboptneighb{\alpha}{k_n}$.
	We cover the full $\Bset$ when
	$\beta^{N} \leq \recip \theta$,
	which is satisfied by $N \geq - \log \theta / \log \beta$.
\end{proof} 

\subsection{Scalar lower bound}

For the matching lower bound,
we begin by
deriving a simplified overestimate of $\suboptneighb{\alpha}{k}$.
We then show that the true $\suboptneighb{\alpha}{k}$
is still a closed interval moving monotonically with $k$.
Finally, we argue that
the gaps between consecutive elements of a cover grow at most geometrically,
while the range of $k$ values in a cover must grow linearly with $\breadth$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:scalar-neighborhood-optimistic}
	For a scalar \DDFproblem\ with $a \geq 1,\ \Bset = [\recip \breadth, 1]$,
	for any $k < 0$,
	if $\alpha \geq 3/2$, then
	$\suboptneighb{\alpha}{k} \subseteq \recip{|k|} [c_1 \!- \!c_2,\ c_1\! + \!c_2]$,
	where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants depending on $\alpha$ and $a$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Beginning with the closed-form solution for $J_b(k)$,
	which can be derived from \eqref{eq:cost-suboptimal},
	we define
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:Jbk}
		J_b(k) = \frac{1 + k^2}{-2(a + bk)}
		\geq \frac{k^2}{-2(a + bk)}
		\defeq \underline{J_b}(k)
		.
	\end{equation}
	By \lemmaref{lem:scalar-cost-ub}, we have
	\(
		J^\star_b < \nofrac{3a}{b^2} \defeq \overline{J^\star_b}
	\),
	so $\ratiolb = \nofrac{\underline{J_b}(k)}{\,\overline{J^\star_b}}$
	is a lower bound on the suboptimality of $k$.
	Computing $\partial^2 \ratiolb / \partial b^2$
	shows that $\ratiolb$ is strictly convex in $b$ on the domain $a + bk < 0$,
	so the $\alpha$-sublevel set of $\ratiolb$ is the closed interval
	with boundaries where $\ratiolb = \alpha$.
	This equation is quadratic in $b$ with the solutions
	\(
		b = -a(3 \alpha \pm \sqrt{9 \alpha^2 - 6 \alpha})/k
	\).
	The resulting interval contains $\suboptneighb{\alpha}{k}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{restatable}{lemma2}{quasi}
\label{lem:subopt-convex}
	For a scalar \DDFproblem, if $\alpha > 1$
	and $k < -1$,
	then $\suboptneighb{\alpha}{k}$ is either empty or a closed interval
	$[b_1, b_2]$,
	with $b_1$ and $b_2$ positive and nondecreasing in $k$.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
The result follows from the quasiconvexity of
both the suboptimality ratio $J_b(k) / J^\star_b$
and the cost $J_b(k)$.
Showing these requires some tedious calculations.

}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:scalar-lb}
	For a scalar \DDFproblem\ defined by
	$a = 1$ and $\Bset = [\recip \breadth, 1]$,
	if $\alpha \geq 3 / 2$, %
	then
	$\coveringnum{\alpha}{\Bset} = \Omega(\log \breadth)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	From the closed-form solution
	\(
		k^\star_{a,b} = -(a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2})/b
	\),
	we observe that $k^\star_b < -1$ for all $b \in \Bset$.
	This, along with the quasiconvexity of $J_b(k)$ in $k$,
	implies that there exists a minimal $\alpha$-suboptimal cover $\coveringset$ for which all $k_i < -1$.
	Suppose $\coveringset = k_1, \dots, k_N$ is such a cover, ordered such that $k_i < k_{i+1}$.
	Then
	by \lemmaref{lem:subopt-convex},
	$\suboptneighb{\alpha}{k_i}$
	and
	$\suboptneighb{\alpha}{k_{i+1}}$
	must intersect,
	so their overestimates according to
	\lemmaref{lem:scalar-neighborhood-optimistic}
	certainly intersect,
	therefore satisfying
	\[
		\frac{c_1 + c_2}{-k_{i+1}}
		\geq
		\frac{c_1 - c_2}{-k_i}
		\implies
		\frac{k_{i+1}}{k_i} \leq \frac{c_1 + c_2}{c_1 - c_2}
		\implies
		\frac{k_N}{k_1} \leq \left(\frac{c_1 + c_2}{c_1 - c_2}\right)^{N-1}.
	\]
	By \lemmaref{lem:scalar-neighborhood-optimistic},
	to cover $b = 1$
	controller $k_1$ must satisfy
	$k_1 \geq -(c_1 + c_2)$,
	and to cover $b = \recip \breadth$,
	controller $k_N$ must satisfy
	$k_N \leq -\breadth(c_1 - c_2)$.
	Along with the previous result, this implies
	\[
		\left(\frac{c_1 + c_2}{c_1 - c_2}\right)^{N-1}
		\geq
		\breadth
		\frac{c_1 - c_2}{c_1 + c_2}
		\implies
		N \geq \frac{\log \breadth}{\log \frac{c_1 + c_2}{c_1 - c_2}}.
	\]
	Recalling that $c_1$ and $c_2$ only depend on $a$ and $\alpha$,
	the $\Omega(\log \breadth)$ dependence on $\breadth$ is established.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the upper bound, it may be possible to compute or bound $\beta$ in the scalar case
		as a function of $a$ and $\alpha$,
		but the analogous result will likely be harder to obtain in the matrix case.
	\item These results impose a lower bounds on $\alpha$ greater than $1$.
		We believe this is a mild condition in control applications:
		if the application demands a suboptimality ratio very close to 1,
		then the size of the suboptimal cover is likely to become impractical for storage.
		However, further theoretical results building upon suboptimal coverings may require eliminating the bound.
\end{itemize}
